# Given two integers L and R, find the count of numbers in the range [L, R] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

# (Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present when written in binary. For example, 21 written in binary is 10101 which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)

# Example 1:

# Input: L = 6, R = 10
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# 6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
# 7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
# 9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
# 10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
# Example 2:

# Input: L = 10, R = 15
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# 10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
# 11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
# 12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
# 13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
# 14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
# 15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
# Note:

# L, R will be integers L <= R in the range [1, 10^6].
# R - L will be at most 10000.
